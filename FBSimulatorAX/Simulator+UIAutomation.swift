extension Simulator {

  /// The converged UI-automation surface for `backend` — element reads and element-targeted actions
  /// over a single query-shaped API. Every call returns a fresh reader; the readers are cheap, and
  /// where a backend owns an expensive warm resource, who owns it differs by backend:
  ///
  /// - `.axBridge(persistence: .shared, …)` reads over a guest `serve` process on the simulator's
  ///   well-known socket, shared with every other process reading the same simulator. The connection is
  ///   released after each round trip so the next reader can have it, and no host ever ends the guest —
  ///   only its own idle timeout does.
  /// - `.axBridge(persistence: .exclusive, …)` reads over a guest of the caller's own, on a socket
  ///   nobody else can discover. Memoized per simulator and per persistence, and holds its connection
  ///   between reads. The guest was spawned with `--exit-on-disconnect`, so closing that connection is
  ///   what ends it — for a process that owns the simulator for its lifetime.
  /// - `.accessibility` and `.axBridge(persistence: .oneShot, …)` are stateless — they hold no warm
  ///   resource, so reconstructing them per call is free.
  ///
  /// Operations reach the display `display` selects, and fail rather than reach another. Only the AXBridge
  /// backends route to a display, so `.accessibility` refuses any selection but `.active`.
