/// An embeddable **outline table** showing the frontmost app's accessibility tree, refreshed on an
/// interval. Selecting a row reports the element, which highlights it on the mirrored screen.
///
/// The table does not act on the device. It is the record of what was seen, and a surface that both
/// reads and taps makes it impossible to tell, watching a recording, whether a row moved because the
/// screen changed or because this window touched it.
///
/// Three properties this is built around, none of which the previous flat table had:
///
/// **Real columns.** One pre-rendered `type "label" #id = value` string per row looks like a table
/// and is not one — it cannot be aligned, resized or read down. Separate columns let the eye scan a
/// single attribute across many rows, which is how anyone actually looks for the odd one out.
///
/// **Disclosure.** The tree is genuinely nested, so structural containers can be collapsed instead of
/// padding the list with rows nobody is reading. On a screen that dumps hundreds of elements this is
/// the difference between a usable table and a wall.
///
/// **Stable identity across refreshes.** The model is rebuilt every second; keying rows by
/// `AXOutlineNode.key` means expansion and selection survive that, and only genuinely changed rows
/// animate. Without it every refresh collapses the tree and drops the selection, which makes an
/// expandable view worthless on a screen being driven.
