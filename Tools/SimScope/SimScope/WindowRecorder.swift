/// Frames come from the window server's composited copy of *our* window, not from a display capture
/// and not from a layer render. That choice buys three things at once: the title bar and toolbar are in
/// frame, the CoreAnimation touch feedback is caught mid-flight (a layer render draws the model tree, so
/// an in-flight ripple would render at its final, invisible state), and nothing that happens to be
/// sitting on top of the window — or anywhere else on the desktop — is ever in the recording.
///
/// ScreenCaptureKit, rather than `CGWindowListCreateImage` on a timer. The older call hands back a lazy
/// image whose pixels are only fetched when it is drawn, and for a window whose app is in the background
/// that fetch costs about a second — a rate of roughly one frame per second, on or off the main thread.
/// An unattended take is always in the background, so that is the only rate that matters here.
