/**
 The simulated device's audio settings, as its apps and the host audio device see them.

 The guest owns this. `SBVolumeControl` holds the level in memory and, whenever it changes, publishes
 it as an integer percentage on the `com.apple.springboard.volumestate` Darwin notification;
 `CoreSimulatorBridge` observes that and writes the value into the settings file. A guest app's
 `AVAudioSession.outputVolume` reads the same number back, and the host CoreAudio process-volume
 scalar is set from it — so this file, and no preferences domain, is where the device's volume is
 observable from.

 That makes it the only way to see the volume from the host, and so the only way to check that a
 hardware volume-button press did anything.

 Two consequences of the guest's bookkeeping are worth knowing, because they are surprising:

 - **It is a mirror, not the source of truth.** SpringBoard publishes to the file and never reads it
   back. Writing to it does not move SpringBoard's own level, and the next button press overwrites it
   from that untouched level.
 - **It resets to 60 when SpringBoard restarts**, because `SBVolumeControl` initialises its level to
   `0.6` and only publishes on a change.
