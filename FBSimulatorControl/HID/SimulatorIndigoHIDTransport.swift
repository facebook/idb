/**
 The legacy HID transport (IndigoHIDRegistrationPort), used where `dtuhidd` is absent or unreachable.

 Builds `IndigoMessage` payloads with `SimulatorIndigoHID` and delivers them through the runtime-only
 `SimDeviceLegacyHIDClient` (owned by `SimulatorIndigoHIDClient`). Guest-side:
 `SimHIDVirtualServiceManager` dispatches on eventKind + target. See `Indigo.h` for wire format.

 An `actor`, so sends are serialized by actor isolation (no `@unchecked Sendable`).
