 The transport for Apple Watch Digital Crown rotation. `dtuhidd` serves the crown on a scroll service
 of its own, beside the digitizer, so this is a second DTUHID connection rather than a second use of
 the first.

 Established on first use and then kept: the guest's crown service belongs to the connection, and
 tearing the connection down before the guest has consumed a turn cancels the turn.

 One per `SimulatorHID`, closed with it.
