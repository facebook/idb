 One host XPC connection to a `dtuhidd` HID service, and the drain that lets events sent on it reach the
 guest before it is torn down. Knows nothing of what the events mean: the digitizer and vendor-defined
 transports each encode their own payloads and write them here.

 A class rather than an actor so `write` is synchronous: a transport assigning order-dependent state
 (a contact's start/position/end) writes before it next suspends, which a hop onto another actor
 would not guarantee. The XPC connection is thread-safe, and the send counters are behind a lock.
