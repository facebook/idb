This is a quick start guide to show you a glimpse of what idb can do. If you haven't installed idb already please refer to [installation](installation.mdx).

Let's start with finding out what simulators/devices are available on your Mac. This will print out all the simulators on your Mac and all of the devices attached.

```
idb list-targets
```

Boot any one of them.

```
idb boot UDID
```

Try any of the commands below and make sure you pass `--udid` to run them with the correct simulator.

```
idb launch com.apple.Maps
idb record
idb log
```

Now let's try to run tests. This will install the test bundle provided on the simulator.

```
idb xctest install Fixtures/Binaries/iOSUnitTestFixture.xctest
```

To verify that it's been installed correctly just run

```
idb xctest list
```

Run the tests by issuing these commands.

* `run logic` would just run the logic tests
* `run app` will run the app tests
* `run ui` will run the ui tests

```
idb xctest run logic com.facebook.iOSUnitTestFixture
idb xctest run app com.facebook.iOSUnitTestFixture com.apple.Maps
```
