// The API injected REPL code calls to drive the connected target. Everything public is
// nested under the `IDB` namespace enum, so importing this module adds only that one
// name to the caller's scope.
//
// The Swift module is named `IDBAPI`, not `IDB`: a type sharing its module's name breaks
// `.swiftinterface` generation (it emits unparseable `IDB.IDB.X` references).
//
// Commands reach the host through `FBReplInvokeHostCommand`, resolved with `dlsym` from
// the loaded `libRepl` (same image, so no link dependency); the only link dependency is
// `ReplProtocol`.
//
// Calls do not throw: a lost connection ends the submission (see `haltReplExecution`),
// and a command that merely did not apply is ignored.
//
// Injected code must not write to stdout/stderr: in the REPL host those file descriptors
// can alias the control socket, so a stray write corrupts the protocol. Failures are
// therefore silent.

/// Sends `command` to the host and returns its `result`, or `nil` when it did not
/// apply or the connection was lost (which also halts the submission via
/// `haltReplExecution`).
