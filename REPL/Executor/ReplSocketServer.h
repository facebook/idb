// Shared REPL socket server, used by both the `libRepl` shim (DYLD-injected into
// an xctest process) and the `SimulatorFrameworkBridge` binary. It binds a
// Unix-domain socket, accepts one connection, and serves newline-delimited JSON
// commands.

// Serves the REPL on `socketPath`. A no-op (returns 0) if `socketPath` is empty.
// Returns 0 on normal completion, non-zero if the socket could not be created.
