/// no more.
///
/// Writes are synchronous and ordered for a single producer, so one driven by
/// a callback — a `URLSession` delegate, a gRPC stream handler — writes from
/// inside the callback without hopping to another context and reordering
/// itself. Bytes written before the process launches are held and flushed at
/// launch, ahead of anything written while the launch is in progress. Two
/// producers writing concurrently get no ordering between them.
///
// SAFETY: `state` is only ever read or written inside `lock`, and the consumer
// it yields is written to after the lock is released, so no caller code runs
// under it.
