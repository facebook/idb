idb is made up of 2 parts, each of which needs to be installed separately.

### idb companion

Each target (simulator/device) will have a companion process attached allowing idb to communicate remotely.

The idb companion can be installed via brew or built from [source](https://github.com/facebook/idb)

```
brew tap facebook/fb
brew install idb-companion
```

Notes: 

1. Instructions on how to install brew can be found [here](https://brew.sh)

2. A full installation of Xcode.app 13.0 is required to compile idb-companion.
Installing just the Command Line Tools is not sufficient.
Xcode can be installed from the App Store.

### idb client

A cli tool and python client is provided to interact with idb.

It can be installed via pip:

```
pip3.6 install fb-idb
```

Note: The idb client requires python 3.6 or greater to be installed.

Note: Instructions on how to install pip can be found [here](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/)

Make sure both parts of idb are installed successfully and then you're good to go! Head over to the [guided tour](guided-tour.mdx) to try idb out.
