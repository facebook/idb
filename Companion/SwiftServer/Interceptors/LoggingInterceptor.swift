/// Logs a one-line summary when a streaming call's client stream closes.
///
/// Call *start* is intentionally not logged here: `CompanionTelemetry` wraps
/// every handler and already logs `<method> called with` at info, so a
/// `Start of` line would duplicate it. Per-frame logging is likewise avoided:
/// a single `hid` stream can carry dozens of frames, so frames are counted
/// and summarized on close instead.
///
/// Call *completion* (success/failure) is intentionally not logged or reported
/// here. `CompanionTelemetry` wraps every handler in a `do`/`catch` and reports
/// completion — and the success/failure `EventReporter` event — reliably on every
/// termination path, so it is the single source for that.
///
/// The frame counter lives inside `intercept`, so one interceptor instance serves
/// every call without shared state.
