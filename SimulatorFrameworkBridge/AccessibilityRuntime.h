// The accessibility runtime as one interface. `FBAXRuntime` states everything the reader needs from the
// four private frameworks (XCTAutomationSupport, AXRuntime, AccessibilityPlatformTranslation,
// RunningBoardServices); `FBAXLiveRuntime` is the only conformer that touches them. Above the seam is
// policy; below it are the dlopens, class lookups, C entry points and reference counting.
//
// Results are tagged unions built only through their factories, so a status and its payload cannot
// disagree, and a `switch` over the status warns on an unhandled case.
